# Docs for Fun and Profit

Here's how you'll find success!

### [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.md)

Information to get up and running with writing conceptual, procedural, and referential content. These types of content can be listed in a single file, or broken out into separate topics depending on your needs.

### [Your First Day](/docs/your-first-day.md)

This is what you do on Day 1. The audience for this content is people on their first day. Information for people who are guiding the new person on their first day would go in another topic, because that's a different audience.

### [Additional Tools](/docs/additional-tools.md)

These are other things you can learn at your leisure.
