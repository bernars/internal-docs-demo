# Getting Started

Information to get up and running with writing conceptual, procedural, and referential content. These types of content can be listed in a single file, or broken out into separate topics depending on your needs.

### In this guide

- [About the process](#about-the-process)
- [Making your first thing](#making-your-first-thing)
- [Fields available in your new thing](#fields-available-in-your-new-thing)

### About the process

This is conceptual content. It answers the questions:

- What is this?
- Why does the reader care?
- What are the limitations?

### Making your first thing

This is procedural content. It outlines the steps for completing a single task.

1. Present prerequisites at the beginning of the steps.
2. Create an ordered list.
3. Don't overload the instructions with lots of sub-tasks.

### Fields available in your new thing

This is referential content. It can be presented as terms and definitions or a table. For help building a Markdown table, see https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables.

| Term  | Definition | Additional Information |
|---|---|---|
| Apple | Sweet fruit that grows in a tree | Great baked in a pie |
| Cherry | Sweet fruit with a pit | Rainier is the best variety |
| Jalape√±o | Mild pepper used in salsa | There are better peppers out there |
